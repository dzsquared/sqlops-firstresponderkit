### Database Dashboard Tab

Selected elements from the First Responder Kit PowerBI dashboard have been replicated in a dashboard tab.  The elements execute against the current database and require the database configured to contain First Responder Kit historical data.  For more information on data collection configuration, please see: https://www.brentozar.com/first-aid/first-responder-kit-power-bi-dashboard/
